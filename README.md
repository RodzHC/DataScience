## Aula 1

### Python

#### Bibliotecas :

1. numpy

   > NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:
   >
   > * a powerful N-dimensional array object
   > * sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
   > * tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
   > * useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities
   >
   > <br/>  

   > Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.

2. matplotlib.pyplot

   > Provides a MATLAB-like plotting framework.

   > pylab combines pyplot with numpy into a single namespace. This is convenient for interactive work, but for programming it is recommended that the namespaces be kept separate, e.g.:

   > import numpy as np
   >
   > import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   > x = np.arange(0, 5, 0.1);
   >
   > y = np.sin(x)
   >
   > plt.plot(x, y)

3. pandas
   > andas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.
